## RStudio Git Integration

RStudio makes it possible to use Git version control through the use of the command line, and supports the most common basic functions with a simple graphical interface
To use the command line two options are available. An external shell (below left) can be activated by clicking `Tools > Shell...`, or by using the in-built RStudio Terminal pane (below right), located next to the Console pane.
Using the command line is the only way to access the full git functionality.
Either should work the same, but I have found that the RStudio Terminal to be a bit sticky, and most of the time, I am able to do get by just using the git pane buttons.
The graphical interface is accesed through the git pane.

## The git pane

When a new project, with git version control enabled is initialised in RStudio, the working directory will appear as shown below in the `Files` tab.
The left pane shows the files present in the current `working directory`, which is currently the same as the `project root directory`.
Here, I have begun a git enabled project, and immediately created three R scripts.

![][new_project]

The pane on the right is the git integration pane.
At the moment, it shows the same files as the Files pane, but this will change as the changes are made to the files in the repo.
The buttons at the top of the pane are, from left to right:

+ __Diff__:
  + Compare changes
+ __Commit__:
  + Add changes to a local repo
+ __Pull__ (Blue down-arrow):
  + Make a local repo match a remote repo
+ __Push__ (Green up-arrow):
  + Add changes in a local repo to a remote repo
+ __History__ (Clock icon):
  + View the history of commits
+ __Other__ (Gear icon):
  + Undoes some changes - `Revert`
  + Opens `.gitignore` for editing
  + Opens a shell terminal
+ __New branch__ (Purple squares icon):
  + Creates a new branch
+ __Branches available__:
  + Lists currently existing branches
  + Offers a way to switch between branches
+ __Refresh__:
  + Refreshes the view if it wasn't updated automatically after changes

## Git status

The git pane lists all the files that git has detected and describes their git status using a column that can contain two icons.
If an icon is located on the right of the column, it indicates the current status is unstaged.
An icon on the left indicates the change has been staged.
The status view reflects the display from using the git command line `git status - s`

+ <span style = 'color:gold'>__??__</span>: Untracked
  + Will not be added to the repository in the next commit
+ <span style = 'color:green'>___A__</span>: Added
  + Added to the index (staging area) and will be added to the repo in the next commit
+ <span style = 'color:blue'>___M__</span>: Modified
  + Indicates an already committed file has been modified and the modifications have been staged ready for commiting
+ <span style = 'color:blue'>__MM__</span>: Modified again
  + A new _unstaged_ modification has occurred in file with a previouly staged, but not commited, modification
+ <span style = 'color:red'>___D__</span>: Deleted
  + A file has been deleted - the deletion also has to be commited otherwise it will return next time you pull from the remote
+ <span style = 'color:purple'>___R__</span>: Renamed
  + A file has been renamed or _moved_ - as with deleted files, this has to be commited

## Adding and commiting files

Git works by taking a snapshot of files and storing them as commits to a repository.
At the command line this done by using the `add` command followed by the names of the files to be added to the staging area (aka _index_ in git speak), eg: `git add .gitignore RStudio-git.Rproj`
Adding the files to the index only tells git you are interested in adding these files to a repo - it doesn't actually add them to the repo though.
To add them to a repo you use the `commit -m` command, where the `-m` denotes message, and the actual message is added afterwards, eg: `git commit -m 'Commit message`
Ie you first __add__ files to the index, then __commit__ those files to the repo.

### Adding

```bash
git add .gitignore Rstudio-git.Rproj
```

Using the git pane, you just click the checkbox for the files you want to add to the staging area.

![][git_add]

### Commiting

To commit using the command line type

```bash
git commit -m 'A meaningful commit message'
```

The git pane alternative is to click the commit button, and when pressed you are presented a window as shown below.
The top left pane shows the files in the working directory and their git status.
The top right is where you should type your commit message.
The bottom pane allows you to review the changes that have occured to a file since it was last commited.

![][git_commit]

## Modifying files

After a while you will have created more file / scripts that you also want to add to the repo.
These files will undergo many changes as your project progresses, of which you will likely want to keep a record.
The image below shows three scripts that have been previously `commit`ed to a repo.
Since they were commited 4 changes have occured.

1. Script_1.R has been modified and added to the staging area
2. Script_2.R was modified, added to the staging area, and then modified again (2 changes)
3. Script_3.R was modified but the changes have not been staged.

![][modified_status]

It is important to know that only the changes that have been staged will be commited to the repo.
Ie, changes to Script_3.R will not be commited, nor will the second change to Script_2.R.
None of the changes will be lost, however.
After commiting, Scripts 2 and 3 will remain in their current state, so you can continue working on them then add and commit the new changes when you are ready.

![][commiting_changes]

Note that in the bottom pane, lines that were added since the file was staged are highlighted in green, and lines that have been removed are highlighted in red.
Also of interest are the options at the top of the bottom pane, in particular the grey bar has two buttons, "stage chunk" and "Discard chunk".
These buttons make it possible to review any changes before staging or commiting.

## Deleting and renaming files

Even file deletions must be staged.
Below Script_1.R was deleted, and staged.
Script_2.R was renamed as Script_4 - but this change has not been staged.
Only when both the deletion and the newly named file are added will this be picked up as a rename, as shown by Script_3.R which was renamed Script_5.R.
